This is our 💩 PHP code that we try to pass off as a Crypto 🦄. 

:poop: developers:

We ❤️ SQL Injections 🤦

We read and share our customers passwords.

We hardcode our credentials for convenience.

## We'll abuse our customers passwords

By writing them to [log files](https://github.com/Sovran-OU/account.sovau.me/blob/main/php-errors_sovau_account.log#L1)

We pretend they are encrypted, but leak our [🔑](https://github.com/Sovran-OU/account.sovau.me/blob/main/enc_secure.php).
